# Adapters

The **Adapters API** allows Lanarky users to build microservices using popular LLM frameworks.

We will cover the following adapters in depth:

- [OpenAI](./openai/index.md): build microservices using the
  [OpenAI Python SDK](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference?lang=python)
- [LangChain](./langchain/index.md): build microservices using the
  [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/)

!!! note "Note from Author"

    The **Adapters API** is still in active development. I will add more adapters in the future.
